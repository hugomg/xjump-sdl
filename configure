# Help message
# ------------
# The command line flags for this congfigure script are inspired by the GNU
# conventions. You can find more info about that in the following links:

Usage: $0 [OPTION]... [VAR=VALUE]...
Configure the installation location and compilation options for Xjump.

By default, \`make install' will install all the files under /usr/local.
You can use the --prefix flag to choose a different location. Defaults for the
options are specified in brackets.

To set compilation variables (e.g. CC, CFLAGS), specify them as VAR=VALUE.
Most of the time it's fine to leave these in the default setting. We use
pkg-config to figure out the appropriate compilation flags for SDL.

General:
    -h, --help         display this help and exit

Instalation directories:
    --prefix=PREFIX    root installation directory [/usr/local]
    --bindir=DIR       where to install executables [PREFIX/bin]
    --datadir=DIR      where to install data files [PREFIX/share]

Compilation variables:
    CC                 C compiler command
    CFLAGS             C compiler flags (-O2 -Wall ...)
    CPPFLAGS           C preprocessor flags (-I<dir> ...)

    LDFLAGS            Linker flags (-L<dir> ...)
    LIBS               Libraries (-l<library> ...)

    SDL_CFLAGS         Additional flags for compiling with SDL2
    SDL_LIBS           Additional flags for linking with SDL2

# Default values
# --------------
# Note that all the following strings are single quoted. Believe it or not,
# everything that you pass as a parameter to make will eventually go through
# Make macro expansion followed by Shell word expansion. Don't entertain the
# notion that these compiler flags and installation directories are just plain
# strings. Any parameters containing special characters like $ or spaces will
# be ruthlessly macro expanded and word split as soon as the makefile tries to
# use them, whether you like it or not. Anyway, the GNU conventions use this
# feature intentionally when setting the default values for the installation
# directories. This way, if the user overrides the root prefix when they call
# `make` then it updates the other definitions too.

# Check for absolute directories

# important that they be absolute directories. We also forbid any paths that
# start with a "~". They can be problematic because shell tilde expansion only
# happens if the tilde is at the start of the word. The end result is that
# the tilde would be expanded when we present the installation paths to the
# user but it not when those paths are used in other places.
